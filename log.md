# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2019 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Create a view that can be dragged and snapped to left and right.

**Thoughts:** It's quite simple, but maybe we can add snap to up or down, also, should the calculation tested?.

**Link to work:** [Draggable View](https://github.com/mantovanirian/DraggableView/commit/6410f40ea49a0f13affdc14663f3145289eefe6b)
